# If-Statements
Saturday Morning Ifs


Just a simple program to practice if statements and another reason to talk about the surf.  I realized that I had " 'check_surf' failed answer statement" appearing at the end of the program.  Used "elsif" to made sure is only appears when necessary.

I am not sure that I need anything on line 41 besides "else".  Will investigate more later.
